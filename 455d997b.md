# Use Zettelkasten for personal reflection

I maintain my private Zettelkasten notes predominantly for **self-reflection** purposes (see <7c5337fc?cf>). 

Every day, I contemplate on the recent life events. I create notes for any new observations/ insights. Then I'll establish links to them in the Zettelkasten, as well as updating folgezettel branching if any. 

During the linking process, I sometimes end up "surprisingly" linking two *otherwise disparate* notions together. This might give rise to a new concept, or I might just merge them together.
