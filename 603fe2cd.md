# Neither express nor repress

The best way to deal with emotions is to neither express them nor repress them.

> By **neither expressing nor repressing** emotions, something new can happen. The emotion is **put into a bind**, it has nowhere to go. Next time anger, say, comes up in a situation, simply decline to have it happen. Observe it as it gets up to all kinds of tricks to have its way. Do not express it – but do not repress it either. Watch what happens ... you will be surprised. Personally, I rid myself of anger in about three weeks when I started on this all those years ago. The more subtle variations like getting peeved, getting irritated and getting annoyed took a little longer, but losing my temper in an angry outburst ended after about three weeks. I kid you not. It all has to do with the determination to succeed, with patience and diligence born out of the pure intent garnered from a peak experience. <http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/audiotapeddialogues/betotallyridofemotionsandpassions.htm>

The ASA article describes it differently:

> Attentiveness is the observance of the basic nature of each arising feeling; it is observing all the inner world  emotional, passionate and calentural  which is whatever is presently taking place in the affective faculty. Attentiveness is seeing how any feeling makes me tick  and how I react to it  with the perspicacity of seeing how it affects others as well. In attentiveness, there is an **unbiased observing** of the constant showing-up of the reality within and is examining the feelings arising one after the other ... and such attentiveness is the ending of its grip.
