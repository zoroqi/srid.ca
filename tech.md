# Tech 

Writing software programs is my passion and profession.

## Creating

* [[[2009703]]] The programming language I use primarily. 
  * [[Neuron]] - What this site itself is published on
  * [[ka Project]] - Neuron NG
* Philosophy
  * [[[47e0e49a]]]

## Using

* [[[X1C7]]] (my laptop)
* [[[linux]]] (What I run on my computers)
* [[[6e549a6d]]] (I [use vim](https://github.com/srid/nix-config/tree/master/nix/nvim) as well)
* GNOME
  * [[[18084e45]]]

## Not actively using

* [[[4fdbc878]]] - Not actively doing, because there are benefits to being able to develop locally, such as on a coffee shop with poor Wifi quality
* [[[9623c240]]] - Windows has come a long way, but Linux still provides a way more [delightful desktop experience][paperwm].
