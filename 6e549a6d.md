# Emacs

[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is an extensible and customizable text editor that is popular among certain programming language communities. Emacs is also suited for taking notes (Ã  la. [orgmode](https://orgmode.org/); though I prefer [[Neuron]]). There are various "configuration kits" for Emacs. 

I use [**doom-emacs**](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs), but [managed entirely in Nix](https://github.com/srid/nix-config/blob/master/nix/doom-emacs.nix).
