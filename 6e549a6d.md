title: Emacs

[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is an extensible and customizable
text editor that is popular among certain programming language communities.
Emacs is also suited for taking notes (à la. [orgmode](https://orgmode.org/);
though I prefer <b6df4059?cf>). There are various "configuration kits" for Emacs. I use [**doom-emacs**](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs).
