# Vipassana hangover

When a former Vipassana meditator (Goenka style) comes to practicing the [[7c5337fc]], there is a distinct danger of carrying over the "body scanning" attitude developed on the meditation cushion. This pollutes any sincere exploration, because awareness stops short (thanks to Vipassana "habit") of physical sensations, never going any deeper.

These physical sensations tend to be the instinctual after-effects, typically in the throat, chest, belly area. The root cause of any feeling cannot be found in these sensations. They are a dead-end. An actualist needs to ignore them, as well proceed straight ahead into the "my" abyss, via feeling it out.

Something to remember here is that despite the serious-sounding phrasing of that last sentence, this whole exploration business is actually rather *effortless* (see [[7857b534]]). 

When proceeding in this manner, you may realize that a bunch of disparate triggers end up converging on some aspect of "me". The whole exploration narrows down to some simple aspect of the psyche ... and just like that -- poof! -- a part of of "me" has gone, or at least began to weaken.
