> *Being a hacker is lots of fun, but it's a kind of fun that takes lots of effort. The effort takes motivation. [...] to be a hacker you have to get a basic thrill from solving problems, sharpening your skills, and exercising your intelligence. If you aren't the kind of person that feels this way naturally, you'll need to become one in order to make it as a hacker. Otherwise you'll find your hacking energy is sapped by distractions like sex, money, and social approval.* ---[esr, How To Become A Hacker](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html)
