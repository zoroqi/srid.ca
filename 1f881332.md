# Non-programming discussion

Where can [hackers](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#what_is) go to have civil and intelligent discussions on matters unrelated to programming?[^actualism]

## Tried and failed

* Hacker News: censorship & non-transparent moderation
* Twitter: easy ambiance of animosity
* Quillette Circle: biased and uncivil members

## New communities to try

While reading this [blog post](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/22/nyt-is-threatening-my-safety-by-revealing-my-real-name-so-i-am-deleting-the-blog/), I came across a couple of reddit communities that may be worth trying:

* [r/slatestarcodex](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex)
* [r/TheMottle](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte)

If you have any recommendations, let me know by email. My criteria are: little censorship of legal content, intelligent discussions on varied topics and members exhibit genuine consideration towards one another.

[^actualism]: Of course, when it comes to the topic of *human happiness* there is no better place on earth than the actualism community (see <7c5337fc?cf>).
