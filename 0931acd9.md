# Social Conditioning

Social conditioning refers to the various beliefs and identities one has taken up while growing up. 

Political liberation movements address elimination of only *superficial* aspects of social conditioning, while conveniently clinging to the deeper aspects. The following quotation illustrates the full range of identities that would go away if one were to eliminate social conditioning in its entirety. 

> [...] superficially there is a composite conditioned social identity that encompasses:
>
>1. A vocational identity as ‘employee’/‘employer’, ‘worker’/‘pensioner’, ‘junior’/‘senior’ and so on.
>2. A national identity as ‘English’, ‘American’, ‘Australian’ and etcetera.
>3. A racial identity as ‘white’, ‘black’, ‘brown’ or whatever.
>4. A religious/spiritual identity as a ‘Hindu’, a ‘Muslim’, a ‘Christian’, a ‘Buddhist’ ad infinitum.
>5. An ideological identity as a ‘Capitalist’, a ‘Communist’, a ‘Monarchist’, a ‘Fascist’ and etcetera.
>6. A political identity as a ‘Democrat’, a ‘Tory’, a ‘Republican’, a ‘Liberal’ and all the rest.
>7. A family identity as ‘son’/‘daughter’, ‘brother’/‘sister’, ‘father’/‘mother’ and the whole raft of relatives.
>8. A gender identity as ‘boy’/‘girl’, ‘man’/‘woman’.
