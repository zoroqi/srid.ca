# WHO has vegetarian bias

Dr. David M Klurfeld's [report](https://peakhuman.libsyn.com/dr-david-klurfeld-on-meat-not-causing-cancer-bogus-vegetarian-scientists-and-balanced-nutrition) of his experience with a WHO working group:

* \[Dr. David M Klurfeld\] was on the World Health Organization working group to decide if meat causes cancer in 2015 with a bunch of vegetarians and vegans and says it was the most frustrating professional experience of his life
* There were 22 scientists - half of which were epidemiologists
* They claimed they used 800 studies but they actually only used 18
* There was a group of people that were strongly against the vote
* He thinks a number of the people made up their minds before they even arrived
