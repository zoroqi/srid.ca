# Don't Prematurely Refactor

Some programmers have the habit of prematurely refactoring code, which often leads to [wrong abstractions](https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction) which requires rewriting anyway as new requirements emerge. As a rule, you let yourself write the duplicate code at least 3 times before considering abstracting it.

> Attempting premature refactoring risks selecting a wrong abstraction, which can result in worse code as new requirements emerge and will eventually need to be refactored again[^wikipedia]
