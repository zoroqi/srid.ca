I practice the <7c5337fc> method to become happier[^happy] in life. 

The method also increasingly influences how I deal with other people (see [1930301](z://conflict)).

[^happy]: 
    It has become fashionable in this day and age to express scorn at the prospect of becoming happier; regardless, by "become happier" I refer to maximizing the felicitous and innocuous feelings:  
    > the felicitous feelings are those that are of a happy and carefree (blithesome feelings of great delight and enjoyment) nature; the innocuous feelings are those that are of a harmless and congenial (gracious feelings of ingenuous tranquillity and affability) nature
    
    while minimizing the "good" and the "bad" feelings:
    > the good feelings are those that are of a loving (ardent feelings of profound affection and endearment) and a compassionate (empathetic feelings of deep sympathy and commiseration) nature; the bad feelings are those that are of a malicious (spiteful feelings of intense hatred and resentment) and a sorrowful (melancholy feelings of yawning sadness and grief) nature
