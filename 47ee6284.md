# Growth Mindset

People with a "growth mindset" believe that they can acquire any given ability provided they invest effort[^eff] as well as actively seek and welcome feedback (positive or negative) especially when stuck, as contrast to having a “fixed mindset”. 

Julia's [How to teach yourself hard things](https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/09/01/learning-skills-you-can-practice/) - mentions growth mindset which, according to the author, *is about replacing the belief “I’m bad at X” with “I haven’t learned about X yet”.*

William Yao writes "*[...] approach things calmly and prepare yourself to not have skills or concepts transfer over, and to start over from a blank slate*" in [Things software engineers trip up on when learning Haskell](https://williamyaoh.com/posts/2020-04-12-software-engineer-hangups.html).
