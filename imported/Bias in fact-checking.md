The so called "fact-checkers" (a part of [[Mainstream Media Bias]]) don't necessarily deal with facts when it comes to politics and other controversial topics.

## Origin

> [Media Matters lobby] had to make us think that we needed a third party to step in and tell us what to think and sort through the information … The fake news effort, the fact-checking, which is usually fake fact-checking, meaning it's not a genuine effort, is a [[Propaganda]] effort … We’ve seen it explode as we come into the [[US Election 2020]], for much the same reason, whereby, the social media companies, third parties, academic institutions and NewsGuard … they insert themselves. But of course, they're all backed by certain money and special interests. They're no more in a position to fact-check than an ordinary person walking on the street … --- [[Sharyl Attkisson]] on Media Bias, [Analysis by Dr. Joseph Mercola](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2020/11/22/sharyl-attkisson-media-bias.aspx)

## Fact-checking the various "fact-checkers"

Below is a list of known rebuttals of some "fact-checkers".

Politifact
: - "*I wanted to show that these fact-checkers just lie, and they usually go unchecked because most people don’t have the money, don’t have the time, and don’t have the platform to go after them — and I have all three*" --- [Candace Owens Challenges Fact-Checker, And Wins](https://www.dailywire.com/news/candace-owens-challenges-fact-checker-and-wins)

Associated Press (AP)
: "*Fact-checking was devised to be a trusted way to separate fact from fiction.  In reality, many journalists use the label "fact-checking" as a cover for promoting their own biases.  A case in point is an Associated Press (AP) piece headlined "AP FACT-CHECK: Trump's inaccurate boasts on China travel ban," which was published on March 26, 2020 and carried by many news outlets.*" --- [Propaganda masquerading as fact-checking](https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2020/04/propaganda_masquerading_as_fact_checking.html)
