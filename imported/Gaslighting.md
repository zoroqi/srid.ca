I prefer the psychoanalytic explanation of **gaslighting** as it is bereft of blaming that is common in victim. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gaslighting&oldid=991474592#Psychoanalytic_explanation),

> In a 1981 article, psychoanalysts Victor Calef and Edward Weinshel argued that gaslighting involves the **projection** and **introjection** (the "transfer") of psychic contents from the victimizer to the victim. The psychic contents include affects, perceptions, impulses, resistances, fantasies, delusions, conflicts. The authors explored a variety of reasons why the victims may have "a tendency to incorporate and assimilate what others externalize and project onto them", and concluded that gaslighting may be "a very complex highly structured configuration which encompasses contributions from many elements of the psychic apparatus"
> 
> Later, psychiatrist Theodore Dorpat described this "transfer" of the victimizer's unconscious psychic contents as an example of **projective identification**. For projective identification to be most effective, the victim would be unaware of being gaslighted. It becomes destructive when the victim as well identifies with the contents of the "transfer" (what has been projected). These effects however are cancelled when the victim becomes capable of disbelieving and disidentifying with the negative introjects that result from projective identification.

We are all familiar with the word "projection", however the keyword here is "introjection" - which describes the same psychic activity seen from "the other side" (the receiver). From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Introjection&oldid=940792981):

> Introjection is a psychoanalytic concept that refers to an unconscious process wherein a person takes components of a person's identity, such as feelings, experiences, and cognitive functioning, and transfers them inside themselves, **making such experiences part of their new psychic structure**. These components are obliterated from consciousness (splitting), perceived in someone else (projection), and then experienced and performed (i.e., introjected) by that other person. Cognate concepts are identification, incorporation, and internalization.

Introjection is a major part of "identify formation", which continues well into adulthood, and arguably is a key element of [[Propaganda]].
