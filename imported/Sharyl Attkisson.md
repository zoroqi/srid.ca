She has written two [[Book]]s on [[Mainstream Media Bias]]. In her own words:

* **The Smear** exposes and focuses on the multi-billion dollar industry of political and corporate operatives that control the news and our info, and how they do it. [ref](https://twitter.com/SharylAttkisson/status/1335614445838606341)
* **Slanted** looks at how the operatives moved on to censor info online[^eg] (and why), and has chapters dissecting the devolution of NYT and CNN, recommendations where to get off narrative news, and a comprehensive list of media mistakes.

[^eg]: For example, [[Google Search is censored]]
