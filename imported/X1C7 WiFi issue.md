WiFi can disconnect from time to time.

[See reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/iu1de6/x1_carbon_w_5k_monitor_running_linux/g5ijbw9/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3); Looks to be [this bug](https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=203709).

This is the most annoying problem with the X1C7. It vanishes for some days, before returning.

In the end, I decided to just use an external wifi card ([[[AC600M USB WiFi Adapter]]])
