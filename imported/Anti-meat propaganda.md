Why do many people believe that plant-based[^term] foods are healthier than animal-based foods? Could this all be (covert) propaganda[^def] that we have not yet recognized as such?

[^term]: The slyly named term "plant-based" in practice actually means "plant-only".

[^def]: > **Propaganda**: Information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view.
