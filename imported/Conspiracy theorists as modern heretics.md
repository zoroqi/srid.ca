"Conspiracy theory" labelling is collective [[Gaslighting]].

> Yesterday’s conspiracy theories often become today’s incontrovertible facts. 

> It’s a function similar to that served by the term “heresy” in medieval Europe. In both cases these are **terms of propaganda, used to stigmatise and marginalise people who have beliefs that conflict with officially sanctioned or orthodox beliefs of the time and place in question**. [...] the treatment of those labelled as “conspiracy theorists” in our culture is analogous to the treatment of those labelled as “heretics” in medieval Europe

## How the term originated as propaganda tool

> The term "Conspiracy Theory" itself was into mainstream American Lexicon by the CIA during the 1960's in an effort to smear individuals who rejected the findings of the Warren Report.
> 
> This is why the term today is associated with "tin foil hat wearing crazy people". The CIA propagandized Americans to immediately dismiss the claims of anyone who was called a "Conspiracy theorist" and to this day that is exactly how the term is used in the Government and Media.
