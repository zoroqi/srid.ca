Google Search no longer provides *authentically* page-ranked results. Heterodox sites are censored, shifting the results to be aligned more to [[Mainstream Media Bias]].

[mercola.com](https://articles.mercola.com/) for example is entirely blocked[^mercola] in Google.

It is recommended[^pop] to use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) as your default search, especially for researching on controversial topics.
