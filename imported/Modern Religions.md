Although human society is increasingly becoming more secular, our religious feelings -- instead of vanishing away -- have simply found different outlets.

For example, in the religion of **veganism**, this manifests in the form of [[[Anti-meat propaganda]]]. And in the religion of **wokeism**, we see creeds like [[[Modern "anti-racism" as a racist religion]]] and rituals like [[[Cuttlefish and male feminists]]].
