# Calisthenics 

For most of my adult life, growing up in
[Chennai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai) and the initial few years in
Canada, I remained physical unfit. South Asians in general do not prioritize
fitness as much as other endeavors \(like academic success\) which may explain
why they tend to have [less favorable body
composition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4821815/) and exhibit
[increased risk](https://www.masalastudy.org) for heart disease. And sitting in
front of the computer for a large part of the day just does not help. I had bad
posture, and was not using all of the body muscles to their full efficiency.

## Fitness industry is a sham

I started by lifting weights in the gym \(my apartment had one\), however it was
such an unexciting experience ... which naturally lead me to calisthenics. I
think the whole fitness industry is overrated, and avoid it like plague.

## Strength vs Hypertrophy

My goal is to develop _functional_ strength---the strength one gains from
resistance training should translate to everyday physical activities that we
take for granted. Hypertrophy \(beyond the necessary level to achieve the
desired strength\) however is an anti-goal; I find it fatuous to carry all that
extra muscle around and ravenously eating more to maintain it.

incidentally, [eats one meal a day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKXOBxcNF3E))

As a result of doing calisthenics I noticed normal activities like walking and
standing becoming "more efficient," in that my posture has dramatically improved
owing to the direct translation of intent, and eventual habituation, to keep the
correct body alignment \(which is what one means by "correct form"\) throughout
any movement.

## My current routine

Nowadays I practice a technique known as [greasing the
groove](https://sealgrinderpt.com/blog/navy-seal-workout/pavels-grease-the-groove-gtg.html/) (in the context of [ladder / pyramid](https://transformetrics.com/content/ladders-pyramids-or-gtg-which-best) style progression) which allows me to practice on a daily basis.

Ideally I'd take formal gymnastic practice, although where I live gymnastic centers tend to cater exclusively to children.

  _experientially_ understanding the role of body alignment in calisthenics.
