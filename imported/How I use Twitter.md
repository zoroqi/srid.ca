**Social engagement** is a good reason to be on social media, such as Twitter. However, we must apply discipline to not get sucked into its "dark corners".

## Rules

- Ignore Home feed; use *Twitter Lists* instead (possibly with [TweetDeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/)).
  - Create separate lists for different domains.
- Be cognizant of trolls 
  - Sometimes otherwise intelligent people may engage in trolling behaviour (eg. those who are "[woke](https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-woke-wokeness/)").
  - Learn the distinction between criticism and toxic behaviour[^vibe].

[^vibe]: Appearing negative (eg: when criticizing something) is not the same thing as emanating a negative **vibe**. See [Experimental evidence of massive-scale emotional contagion through social networks](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788). Cf. [[2015101]]. 

## Tools

- Remove distracting rubbish[^clickbait]
  - On desktop, use [Minimal Twitter](https://github.com/thomaswang/minimal-twitter)

[^clickbait]: Especially the clickbait content that Twitter forces into your valuable attention.
