Accept it or not, we are increasingly being dependent on software running on the [cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing), a large proportion of which are controlled by central authorities[^decen]. For eg., if you let your email, photos, files managed by Google's software, they are effectively in control of the central authority of Google. If these central authorities decide to [suspend] your account, you lose access to them all.

[^decen]: A gradual migration to decentralized software should hopefully mitigate this concentration of powers.

As tech censorship increasingly gets political, this *could* happen (see [[Google Search is censored]] & [[Mainstream Media Bias]]) if your content goes against orthodox views. Among people holding heterodox views (such as myself), if left unchecked, this could lead to a feeling of indignation, which further can enact the coping mechanism of affectively orienting oneself to the staunch position of wanting to become independent of these central authorities.

The problem with this attitude is that it is an emotional reaction, and not one determined from an affectively neutral position, allowing full use of intelligence in the decision-making.

There are risks to everything in life, and in regards to this particular problem of censorship and deplatforming, I'd think that it'd prudent to use a central authority's software for managing one's critical data[^backup] only as long as they do not use their platform to expouse heterodox views. This seems like a reasonable compromise to me.

[^backup]: And of course maintaining regular *backups* of this data is extremely important, regardless of where you decide their primary storage be.
