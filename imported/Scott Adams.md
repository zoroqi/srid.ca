An Haskeller, Michael Snoyman, recommended Scott's book [[Loserthink]] [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/snoyberg/status/1292684431203893249). The book begins with highlighting the blind public trust (not based on factual understanding) on climate science and red meat [[Propaganda]]. 

Scott also writes about [[US Election 2020]] fraud lawsuits, and have given his heterodox view of [[Donald Trump]] (See [[Donald Trump's personality]]).
