# Love is a choice

Falling in love is a **choice** one makes deep down one's psyche.

> RICHARD: To **fall in love** is not something which just happens involuntarily; the feelings of love are aroused by the presence of the potential lover and it is **a choice made deep-down**, at the core of one’s being, to either go with the powerful passions engendered, and thus become and be that very passion, or not[^richard]

[^richard]: [Richard’s Selected Correspondence On Fear](http://actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedcorrespondence/sc-fear2.htm)

It is *not any different* to the choice one makes (see <974ce006?cf>), say, to feel bad. Love is not any more special --- in regards to that choice --- than all those little and "unimportant" feelings one chooses to feel during one's life.

Also, in the absence of love, *togetherness* and *closeness* that normally precede falling in love are now left to morph instead[^bif] into *sweetness* ("[delighting in the pervasive proximity, or immanence, of the other](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedcorrespondence/sc-intimacy.htm)").
