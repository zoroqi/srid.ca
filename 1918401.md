# Carnivore diet

I eat only animal-based foods.[^coffee]

[^coffee]: Coffee being a delightful exception.

## Why?

In early 2013 a licensed medical doctor impetuously prescribed me enough antibiotics[^prescription] so as to [mess up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysbiosis) my gut (and possibly skin) microbiome. This lead to what was then a mild folliculitis to become severe chronic folliculitis with chronic seborrhoeic dermatitis following suit.

[^prescription]: Minocycline, 100g a day for 30 days--had to stop due to severe side effects. Then another prescription of the same but 50g a day, followed by same side effects. After stopping the second round of antibiotics, within about a week the skin reactions -- 30+ pus-filled inflammatory boils in face, neck and eventually scalp -- started.

I suffered with this condition for over 4 years, and saw plethora of dermatologists \(who knew naught but to prescribe ever more antibiotics[^moreanti]\; one even had me do low-dose Accutane). Then, just within two weeks of going on the carnivore diet \(beef, salt and pepper\) my symptoms reduced to about 95%, and further cleared up to 99% when I stopped spices. Over the next years I was to reintroduce several plant foods[^reint]; and everytime I do, my symptoms would come back in vengeance.

[^reint]: I have not totally lost interest in reintroducing plant foods; and this is something I try every once in a while. In the ideal world, I'd love to be able to eat some plant carbohydrates on a predominantly animal-based diet.

[^moreanti]: Cefalexin, doxycycline and one another antibiotic that I don't remember the name of. They work temporarily, anywhere from 2 weeks to 3 months, and then the symptoms return even more severely than before!

## Is it safe?

Contrary to popular belief, the carnivore diet provides all the necessary nutrients and is generally safe to do long-term. Meat is [nutritionally complete food](http://www.diagnosisdiet.com/food/meats/), and [some indigenous groups](https://justmeat.co/peoples/) have traditionally eaten an all-meat diet.

One ought to pay lip service to general medical wisdom and any dominant nutrition ideology as they are laced with an anti-meat bias \(see below\) using [problematic epidemiological studies](https://www.diagnosisdiet.com/epidemilogical-studies/) where, depending on the researcher's nutritional bias, one can establish [_any_ food item to be problematic](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/97/1/127/4576988). For a telling instance of how biased health organizations can be, see <23ad7009?cf> (and others at <2015201>).
