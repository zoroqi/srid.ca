# Haskell

[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) is an advanced, purely functional programming language. I use Haskell because of its correctness guarantees that are difficult or impossible to achieve with mainstream programming languages.

I use the language to write complete web applications, which is to say that even frontend code is written in Haskell (compiled to JavaScript via GHCJS); I highly recommend [[obelisk]] for writing web apps in Haskell.

[On GitHub](https://github.com/srid) you can find a list of Haskell projects I've worked on (and been working on), the notable of which is [[[neuron]]], as well as [[[ka]]].

Here are some longform articles I wrote; they are also displayed in the front page:
