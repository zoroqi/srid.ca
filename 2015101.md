# Politeness as a tool for malice

Politeness in a civilized society exists to make interactions among people as smooth as possible. However, more than a few groups of people have taken up the notion of politeness as a gaslighting mask for projecting their malicious feelings (notably feelings of offense) onto others.

## Conflict handling

The most well-known recommendation to handle conflicts is to communicate with more explicit civility. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/cc1rxb/how_i_intend_to_help_steer_ghc_reasonably/etkctsa/) is an example of what this means in practice.

### Where civility falls short

Explicitly added civility in communication reportedly has the effect of minimizing the chances of conflict. This is called _managing_ the problem of conflicts. When the problem does not exist in the first place, however, there is nothing to manage. _Eliminating_ the possibility of conflicts, wherever possible, is patently superior to merely letting them happen in a controlled fashion.

Moreover civility can be used to _hide_ the feeling of ill will or misbehaviour; [for instance](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/cc1rxb/how_i_intend_to_help_steer_ghc_reasonably/etm7k89/?context=3):

> I think it's worth adding that civility can be a shield for people who are expert at playing political games, and I think there are certain people in the community who are just that... and do that. I won't elaborate here, but suffice it to say that I have definitely had exchanges with prominent members of the community where I got the **distinct feeling** that that person was really just sandbagging while being **very polite** and **making every effort** to appear impartial.

Or,

> The leadership style in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) is **extremely aggressive and authoritarian**.

When push comes to shove, civility--no matter the level of dose applied--does [virtually nothing](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/331513/135122) to prevent the feeling of offense:

> ... once enough people are piling on to complain or tell you what's wrong with what you did, you're going to **feel attacked** - even if every single comment is **worded politely and respectfully**.

Which means that the palliative remedy of civility, while even exacerbating the problem at times, is not the exemplary solution that many people claim it to be.

## Incidences

### John de Goes

I originally learned of this pattern when coming across the whole Typelevel incident against the programmer John de Goes. In summary: Typelevel accused John of being rude because of his comments on Github, and yet the people (including myself) who looked over those comments [found no problematic behaviour](https://old.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/d0uqp9/jon_pretty_condemns_deplatforming_attempt_against/ezg1pv5/).

Typelevel has, essentially, kicked John using politeness as a tool.

### NoRedInk

Another incident of similar theme was reported by a former employee of the company NoRedInk [wrote this comment](https://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/why-im-leaving-elm/#comment-4868497335):

> If only I could have read this years ago, before I had the misfortune of working at NoRedInk. The team shows a bewildering mix of cargo-cult inclusiveness coupled with inability to consider that anyone could be different from them in any way that matters. I've never before or since met a group where a mentor would advise someone to "show more curiosity" by asking fewer questions!

> \[I was\] fired halfway through the period for "engaging in conflict" which I can only speculate referred to a bizarre conversation on company Slack about whether or not it made sense to add a cache.
