# Developing on a dedicated server


At the end of May 2020, I began renting a dedicated server ([Ryzen 7 3700 PRO](https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/dedicated-servers/infra/infra-limited-edition-2/)) for hosting [Cerveau](https://neuron.zettel.page/041726b3.html). A month later I decided to also use it as my *primary development* machine.

## Benefits

I find developing on a dedicated machine to be beneficial in many ways:

* **Portable lifestyle**: Full access to powerful development environment regardless of where I'm. I could be in a coffee shop with my Pixel Slate hybrid tablet.

* **Portable performance**: For lifestyle reasons, I am stuck with the maximum power laptops could offer. Even my "mobile workstation" Thinkpad P71 cannot match the CPU performance of the dedicated server. The latter compiles Haskell projects way faster.

* **Upgrade often**: In a year, if I wish I could upgrade my dedicated server to a better performance-to-price ratio. Since I use <c7170724?cf>, migrating to a new server is simply a matter of using the declarative config and running `nixos-rebuild switch`[^install].

## Revival of the thin client

My next portable computer will likely be a Chromebook with retina-quality display and Thunderbolt support (for connecting to the 5k display). At the moment, however, I'm content with using the too-powerful P71 as a "thin client" to the dedicated server.
