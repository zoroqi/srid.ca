# Belief: Haskell is not for average people

There is a widespread belief[^def] that Haskell is suitable for use only by "smart" people. And that "average" programmers are better off with something "easier". The programming language Go's success can in part be attributed to the class[^naming] of such beliefs.

[^def]: A **belief**, here, is defined as "*an emotion-backed thought [...] made to appear real or true only by [the] emotional support for the belief, by [one's] passionate feelings, intuition and imagination*". -- [Topics - Belief](http://actualfreedom.com.au/library/topics/belief.htm)

[^naming]: If you know what this *class* of beliefs is called, please let me know. More generally, it refers to a deeply-held belief and faith about the incompetence of the general public (the average people), thereby rationalizing the desire to relegate them to some inferior position in society, while also submitting oneself to it and thereby defending it (i.e., the *opposite* of <47ee6284?cf>).
