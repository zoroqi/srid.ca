# Be sincere, but not serious

The actualism method should be practiced with sincerity{.ui .blue .label}, which is not the same as seriousness{.ui .red .label}, and it is all about having fun.

> RICHARD: You need to have a keen sense of humour. This business of becoming free is not – contrary to popular opinion – a serious business at all. Be totally sincere ... most definitely utterly sincere, as genuineness is essential. But serious ... no way. An actual freedom is all about having fun; about enjoying being here; about delighting in being alive. All that ‘being serious’ stuff actively works against peace-on-earth. One has to want to be here on this planet ... most people resent being here and wish to escape. This method will bring one into being more fully here than anyone has ever been before. If you do not want to be here, then forget it. <http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/selectedwriting/sw-method.htm>
